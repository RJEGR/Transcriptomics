A non-guided transcriptome assembly usually aims to the _de novo_ assembly method of creating a transcriptome without the aid of a reference genome. The availability of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies allows researchers to capture the spatial or temporal profile of gene expresion from a huge types of biological samples. The Following markdown describe an integrative workflow analysis in RNA-seq data based on the current bioinformatic methods.

The Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE), Mexico have a computer cluster [(Paper) ](http://todos.cicese.mx/sitio/noticia.php?n=827#.WsJ-23XwZhE) with many bioinformatic apps installed within ready to implement by subscribed users.
