A non-guided transcriptome assembly usually aims to the _de novo_ assembly method of creating a transcriptome without the aid of a reference genome. The availability of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies allows researchers to capture the spatial or temporal profile of gene expresion from a huge types of biological samples. The Following markdown describe an integrative workflow analysis in RNA-seq data based on the current bioinformatic methods.
